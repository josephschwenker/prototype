TODO
b	When game.moving, hovering over the source tile still shows the last path
	Show number of moves remaining when using mouse movement
		Tiles out of range show up red
		Queue moves for next turn
	Switch to VS Code
	Slight delay between moving units between tiles when using mouse movement
	Slide units from one tile to the next when moving (position: absolute)
	Replace structures array with pointer to a ResourceStructure
	Bug: "Improvement already exists" instead of "Terraform complete"
	Make actions and status variables on the Game object
	Switch coordinates to x, y, z instead of z, y, x
	Structures of different classes can stack: ResourceStructure, MovementStructure, MilitaryStructure, ExtraResourceStructure
	Convert to model-view-controller (game.renderingPath)
	Convert to TypeScript
	Verify multiple engineers aggregate work correctly
		turns remaining should never be less than 1
		make totalProgress a static variable of the class
		un-assign all assigned units when one unit finishes production
		moving an engineer revokes its assignment
	Prohibit bases from harvesting the same resource tiles, oldest base takes precedence
	Show outline of base radius before confirming build
	Show message log: population growth, production complete, terraform complete, structure already exists, etc.
	Population growth
	Base radius grows with population
	Accumulate nutrients/credits/minerals
	Research
	Society modules
	Unit designer: mixins, Object.prototype.assign(target, source)
	Economy bonus to cities connected with roads, attenuates exponentially with distance
	AI-controlled players
	Save/restore using Game object
	
	Write to filesystem
	Port to Node.js
	Multiplayer
	Preload all files automatically
	Modify interface mockup, implement blurred background effect, merge with prototype
	Base control should display around base
