TODO
	Mouse movement (right click to move active unit, display path before release)
		Prefer straight path
	"Improvement already exists" instead of "Terraform complete"
	"Invalid command" when button/shortcut not valid
	Should not play open base control sound if base control already open
	Switch coordinates to x, y, z instead of z, y, x
	Structures of different classes can stack: ResourceStructure, MovementStructure, MilitaryStructure, ExtraResourceStructure
	Replace structures array with pointer to a ResourceStructure
	Convert to model-view-controller
	Rectangular map (Civilization-style shape)
	Verify multiple engineers aggregate work correctly
		turns remaining should never be less than 1
		make totalProgress a static variable of the class
		un-assign all assigned units when one unit finishes production
		moving an engineer revokes its assignment
	Prohibit bases from harvesting the same resource tiles, oldest base takes precedence
	Show outline of base radius before confirming build
	Show message log: population growth, production complete, terraform complete, structure already exists, etc.
	Population growth
	Accumulate nutrients/credits/minerals
	Research
	Society modules
	Unit designer: mixins, Object.prototype.assign(target, source)
	Economy bonus to cities connected with roads, attenuates exponentially with distance
	AI-controlled players
	Save/restore using Game object
	
	Write to filesystem
	Port to Node.js
	Multiplayer
	Preload all files automatically
	Modify interface mockup, implement blurred background effect, merge with prototype
	Base control should display around base
